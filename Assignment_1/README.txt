- There is one server folder and three client folders for multithreading testing.

- All three client folders have EXACTLY the same file.

- server file takes only one arg at terminal which is port

- client takes two args, first is IP of server, second if port of server


- There are three options to choose from in Menu:

print "================================================================="
print 'Press 1 to search something'
print 'Press 2 to download a file'
print 'Press 3 to exit search engine'
print "================================================================="

-Press 1 then enter your search query and it will return all matches in the given dataset including inside folders and subfolders

-Search returns File names, line number of text (if any), and folder location

-Press 2 to download a file, it will ask for a SINGLE string which has file name first followed by path to file with a SPACE in between. SPACE IS NECESSARY

Example: 124.txt <space> /home/zainqasmi/Desktop/FINAL/Server/bbcsport/rugby

- Use the above given example. You can copy/paste location that you got from your search query
- Error will be generated if file does not exist, otherwise your file will be downloaded


- Every feature was working flawlessly last I checked.
